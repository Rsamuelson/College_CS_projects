	Programming Practice 1
	<Reflection 1 What were you tying to learn or achieve?>
		in this programming practice I was able to learn who to complete a basic 
		program on my own with out the use of a instruction manual. The thing that
		I learn how to do first is to tell where to access the from.
	<Reflection 2 Were you successful? Why or Why not?>
		at first no but after a couple of problems with the program not being found 
		in the file that i told it to pull from, it worked fine.
	<Reflection 3 Would you dopP anything differently if starting this 
	program over? if so, explain what.>
		Not really, just the basics were needed in this programming practice so 
		not much was required.
	<Reflection 4 Think about the most important thing you learned 
	when writing this piece of code. What was it and explain why it 
	was significant.>
		the code problems that I incouontered were not that problemmatic but 
		operating the Cygwin terminal was complicated for me.
